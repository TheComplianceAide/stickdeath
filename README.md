## What is This?

**Stick Death** is a minimalist arena shooter where the only thing that matters is the visceral, physics-based chaos of stick figures meeting their demise. Built from the ground up in a **single HTML file** with **no libraries or dependencies**, it's a testament to what's possible with pure JavaScript and a whole lot of math.

Blast through waves of enemies, watch them crumble with hilarious ragdoll physics, and trigger cinematic slow-mo on epic headshots.

## ‚ú® Features

*   **Custom Ragdoll Physics:** A from-scratch Position-Based Dynamics (Verlet) engine for maximum comedic effect. Limbs can even break and detach!
*   **Cinematic Slow-Mo:** Land a headshot and the world slows down, letting you savor the moment.
*   **Adjustable Gore:** From `Off` to `Full`, you control the level of particle-based carnage.
*   **Multiple Weapons:** Switch between a Pistol, an SMG, and a screen-shaking Shotgun.
*   **Adaptive Performance:** The game automatically adjusts effects and physics calculations to target a smooth 60 FPS on any device.
*   **Desktop & Mobile Ready:** Play with WASD/Mouse or use the on-screen twin-stick controls on your phone.
*   **100% Client-Side:** No servers, no build steps, no internet required. It runs directly from the `file://` protocol.

## ü§ñ The Genesis: An AI-Generated Game

This isn't just a game; it's an experiment. The entire project was generated by an AI agent from a single, incredibly detailed prompt file: [`buildthisgame.txt`](buildthisgame.txt).

This file contains the full technical specification, from the physics engine implementation down to the audio synthesis parameters. It's an exploration of prompt engineering and AI-driven development, demonstrating how a clear and comprehensive spec can be translated directly into a fully functional product.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Deep Dive

For the developers in the room, here's what makes this project special:

*   **Single File Architecture:** All HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are contained within [`index.html`](index.html).
*   **Zero Dependencies:** No frameworks, no libraries, no external assets. Just pure, vanilla web technologies.
*   **Custom Physics Engine:** A lightweight Position-Based Dynamics (Verlet) solver brings the ragdolls to life.
*   **Procedural Audio:** All sounds are synthesized on the fly using the Web Audio API. No `.mp3` or `.wav` files needed.
*   **Responsive & Adaptive:** From the UI to the performance-tuning logic, it's designed to run well anywhere.
